/// Threads in ThreadAbstraction can be either be started or not started, via the `spawn_if`
/// method.
///
/// # Why?
///
/// This exists due to a dilemma Encore once had, it boils down to this:
///
/// 1. Spawn thread
/// 1. Thread (usually with a compile time cfg!) checks if said feature is enabled
/// 1. Worst case, thread immedately `return`s
/// 1. Thread ends up being spawned, resulting in an additonal syscall, and possibly increased
///    binary size
///
/// Instead, ThreadAbstraction prevents the thread from starting if a compile time condition says
/// so, but still allows regular ol `spawn`ing of threads.
///
/// # Disadvantages
///
/// It does not provide full `JoinThread<T>` parity. Only few methods are implemented.

    /// spawn(move || { println!("this will run!") });
